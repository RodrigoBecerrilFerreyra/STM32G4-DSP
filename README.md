# NUCLEO-G431KB / STM32G431KB Template Project

This repository serves as a template for starting projects with the STM32G431KB microcontroller, as well as the NUCLEO-G431KB evaluation board. Much of the template can be modified to fit most STM32-series microcontrollers and NUCLEO evaluation boards. All files .gitignore, main.c, Makefile, LICENSE-2.0.txt, and README.md are sourced from the following repositories:
